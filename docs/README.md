# Chatbot UX Explorations Overview

This document provides a deeper dive into the themes and explorations a part of **Chatbot UX Explorations**. Each theme focuses on improving different aspects of chatbot interactions, offering solutions that enhance how users engage with conversational interfaces. Within each theme, you’ll find **explorations**—individual projects designed to test and prototype specific ideas.

## Themes and Explorations

### 1. Conversational Bookmarking and Annotation

**Conversational Bookmarking and Annotation** focuses on improving how users organize and manage conversations with chatbots. Inspired by tools commonly found in notetaking and journaling apps, this theme seeks to make interactions more structured, intuitive, and personalized. The goal is to provide users with features that allow them to easily reference and revisit important parts of their chat history, increasing the utility and longevity of chatbot conversations.

#### Exploration: Favoriting Conversations and Responses

> **Status**: In Progress

The **Favoriting Conversations and Responses** feature allows users to mark specific parts of a conversation, or entire conversations, as "favorites." This functionality is designed to help users identify and return to critical moments in their chat interactions.

- **Objective**: To provide users with a quick and simple way to save important information within a conversation, similar to bookmarking a webpage or highlighting text in a document.
- **How it Works**: Users can click a "favorite" button next to any conversation response. Favorited responses are then accessible via a sidebar, which lists all the favorited items for easy navigation.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Revisiting important pieces of advice or instructions given by the chatbot.
  - Saving useful parts of the conversation for future reference during ongoing projects or research.
  - Organizing key moments for review, especially during long or complex conversations.

#### Exploration: Conversational Tagging

> **Status**: Upcoming

**Conversational Tagging** builds on the favoriting feature by allowing users to assign custom tags to specific responses or conversations. This feature will give users more granular control over how they organize and retrieve conversation data, offering a flexible way to categorize interactions based on their own workflow or needs.

- **Objective**: To allow users to create and apply custom tags to different parts of a conversation, enabling better categorization and retrieval of key information.
- **How it Works** (Planned):
  - Users will be able to assign one or more tags to individual responses.
  - A "tags" section in the sidebar will allow users to filter and view conversations by specific tags.
  - Tags can be created and managed by users, offering a customizable way to organize information.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Tagging responses with project-specific labels (e.g., "Action Items," "Resources," "Feedback").
  - Categorizing parts of conversations for easy reference (e.g., "Questions," "Clarifications," "To Review").
  - Quickly filtering through a long conversation to find specific types of content.

#### Exploration: Intra-Conversation RAG

> **Status**: Planned

**Intra-Conversation Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** allows users to retrieve key responses that may have fallen out of the context window during long conversations. This feature enhances interaction efficiency by reducing the need to manually search through long chat histories.

- **Objective**: To provide users with an easy way to retrieve responses from earlier in the conversation, ensuring that important information can be referenced even after it falls out of the AI's immediate context window.
- **How it Works** (Planned):
  - Users will be able to search for or recall earlier responses, with a tool or sidebar surfacing relevant points on demand.
- **Use Cases**:
  - When discussing complex topics, users can quickly bring back previously mentioned information that has fallen out of the conversation context.
  - Provides a way to access important details without scrolling through long conversation histories.

### 2. Stepwise Conversational AI

**Stepwise Conversational AI** explores how chatbots can guide users through complex processes or learning materials in a structured, step-by-step format. This theme is inspired by how educational modules, onboarding processes, and presentations are typically structured. Instead of overwhelming users with too much information at once, stepwise interactions break down content into manageable pieces, offering opportunities to ask follow-up questions, revisit previous sections, and fully absorb each part of the conversation before moving forward.

#### Exploration: Stepwise Conversational AI

> **Status**: Planned

This exploration will develop step-by-step chatbot interactions that guide users through processes or workflows in a structured manner. Whether for education, onboarding, or troubleshooting, this exploration aims to create more manageable and engaging chatbot experiences that adapt to user progress and needs.

- **Objective**: To create chatbot flows that guide users step-by-step through a process, ensuring they fully understand each stage before moving on. The goal is to improve user comprehension and retention while handling complex topics or multi-step workflows.
- **How it Works** (Planned):
  - Chatbots will present content in discrete steps, with each step focusing on a specific part of the overall topic or process.
  - Users will be able to ask follow-up questions about any step or revisit previous steps for further clarification.
  - The chatbot will adjust the flow based on user inputs, ensuring a tailored experience.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Onboarding**: Introducing new users to a product or service by guiding them through the setup or initial learning steps.
  - **Educational Modules**: Breaking down complex topics into smaller lessons, allowing users to learn at their own pace while ensuring comprehension of each step.
  - **Troubleshooting**: Assisting users with step-by-step troubleshooting for technical issues, ensuring they understand each action before proceeding.
