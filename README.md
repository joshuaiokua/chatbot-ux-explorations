# chatbot-ux-explorations

**Chatbot UX Explorations** is a collection of prototypes and experiments designed to explore and enhance chatbot user experiences (UX). These explorations span from practical improvements to current chatbot interfaces and interactions—such as making conversations more intuitive and accessible—to playful, imaginative ideas that push the boundaries of what chatbot interactions could become.

Built with **TypeScript**, this repo primarily leverages **LangChain**'s family of libraries, including LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith, to bring these concepts to life.

## Getting Started
>
> **NOTE:** Eventually these explorations will be hosted and *explore-able* on a website, but for now, you can run them locally.

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-ux-explorations.git
   cd chatbot-ux-explorations
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Explorations

See `docs` for write-ups and fuller information on each exploration.

### Conversation Tagging

This experiment focuses on enhancing user interactions with chatbots by introducing the ability to tag and organize key moments within conversations. By prototyping features that allow users to easily reference important points—whether for research, follow-up tasks, or personalized use cases—it demonstrates how this seemingly small addition can significantly increase user control over their chat history. Drawing inspiration from note-taking apps and task managers, this exploration ultimately seeks to improve the overall conversational experience by making interactions more structured, intuitive, and user-friendly.
