# chatbot-ux-explorations

A collection of projects exploring chatbot user experience (UX), either prototyping features I believe are underdeveloped or missing in current popular implementations, or playfully investigating more imaginative ideas about how we might interact with chatbots (e.g., what might it mean for us to "hallucinate"?). Built with JavaScript/TypeScript, this repo primarily leverages LangChain's family of libraries (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith) to bring these ideas to life.
